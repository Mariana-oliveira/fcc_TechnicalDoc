                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
                    CSS is a technology used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) and  Javascript is a programming language used to give functionality/behavior to the website.
                    This 3 pieces together make de Web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. This "markup" is called by element.

                <p>Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document — the <code> &lt; meta &gt; </code> element. 
                    Of course, the other stuff we are talking about in this article could also be thought of as metadata too. There are a lot of different types of <code> &lt; meta &gt; </code> 
                    elements that can be included in your page's <code> &lt; head &gt; </code>, but we won't try to explain them all at this stage, as it would just get too confusing. 
                    Instead, we'll explain a few things that you might commonly see, just to give you an idea.

                <header>Elements</header>

                <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<code> &lt; </code>" and "<code> &lt;</code>".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive.</p>
                
                <p>An element is composed by the following parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The opening tag: </strong>This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                        <li><strong>The closing tag: </strong>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
                        <li><strong>The content: </strong>This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                        <li><strong>The element: </strong>The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
